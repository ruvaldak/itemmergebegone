# Item Merge Begone

I hate how items merge into a single entity in Minecraft so I made this.

## Why?
Because I like the aesthetic. The chaos. The visceral satisfaction of picking up a ton of items off the ground.

## Build / Install
1.  Clone this.
2.  Run `./gradlew build`.
3.  Throw the jar in your mods folder.
4.  Profit.
5.  ???
6.  Why are there more bullet points past "Profit"?

## Performance Warning
Minecraft merges items for performance reasons.
If you use this mod and decide to blow up 20 double chests full of cobblestone, your framerate is probably going blow up with them.

* **Don't** use this on a server with massive mob farms unless you like lag.
* **Don't** come crying to me if your quarry creates a black hole of entities.

You have been warned. Enjoy the pretty piles of loot.
